To make this dream a reality, pack:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Warm Coats:</strong> A water-resistant, insulated coat that reaches below the knees is a must-have. Opt for a combination of down and synthetic insulation for maximum warmth.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sweaters and Knits:</strong> Layer up with thick sweaters, wool turtlenecks, and cozy knits. Merino wool is a great choice as it&rsquo;s warm, breathable, and naturally odor-resistant.</p></li><li><p><strong>Thermal Underwear:</strong> These are your secret weapon against the cold. Wear them under your clothes for an extra layer of warmth.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scarves, Hats, and Gloves:</strong> Protect your head, neck, and hands from the chilly air.
