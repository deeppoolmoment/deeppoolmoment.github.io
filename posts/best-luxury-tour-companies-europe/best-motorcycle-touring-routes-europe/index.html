It&rsquo;s a good idea to purchase travel insurance before you start your trip.</p><p><strong>8. Have Your Motorcycle Serviced</strong></p><p>Before you start your trip, have your motorcycle serviced by a qualified mechanic. This will help to ensure that your motorcycle is in good condition and ready for the journey.</p><p><strong>9. Pack Light</strong></p><p>You&rsquo;ll be doing a lot of riding, so it&rsquo;s important to pack light. Bring only the essentials and leave the rest at home.</p><p><strong>10. Take Breaks</strong></p><p>It&rsquo;s important to take breaks while you&rsquo;re riding.
